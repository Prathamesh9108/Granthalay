# ग्रंथालय (Granthalay) — Library Management System (Flutter Frontend)

**ग्रंथालय** is an Android-first, bilingual (मराठी & English) Library Management System frontend developed in Flutter and Dart using Material Design 3. It is designed to manage approximately 2,000 library books and provide daily operational tools for a library librarian.

The application operates completely offline in **Interactive Demo Mode** with realistic Marathi and English sample data, while following a clean **Repository & Service Pattern** fully prepared for future integration with a **Spring Boot REST API**.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Bilingual Localization (मराठी / English)**:
   - Default language: **मराठी (Marathi)**.
   - Instant language switching without restarting the app.
   - Persisted in `SharedPreferences`.
   - Real Marathi book titles and author names remain untouched while UI labels, buttons, forms, and dialogs dynamically update.
   - Configured with `lib/l10n/app_mr.arb` and `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`.

2. **Typography & Styling**:
   - Modern Material 3 styling with clean surfaces, rounded cards (14-16px radius), and high-contrast readable layouts.
   - Deep Royal Blue primary (`#1E3A8A`) with Teal (`#0D9488`) and Emerald Green accents.
   - Native Devanagari typography chain (`Noto Sans Devanagari` / `Mangal` / `Nirmala UI`) ensuring crisp Marathi rendering, proper matras, and conjuncts.

3. **17 Complete Working Screens**:
   - **Screen 1: Splash Screen** — Animated branding with dual language title and subtitle.

## 🔌 Future Spring Boot REST API Integration

The application has been constructed with a clean architecture that completely isolates demo data from the UI layer through repository contracts (`BookRepository`, `MemberRepository`, `BorrowingRepository`) and `ApiService`.

### Prepared API Endpoints:
| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/books` | Fetch all books |
| `GET` | `/api/books/{id}` | Fetch book by ID |
| `POST` | `/api/books` | Add new book |
| `PUT` | `/api/books/{id}` | Update book details |
| `DELETE` | `/api/books/{id}` | Delete book |
| `GET` | `/api/members` | Fetch all members |
| `GET` | `/api/members/{id}` | Fetch member by ID |
| `POST` | `/api/members` | Register new member |
| `PUT` | `/api/members/{id}` | Update member details |
| `GET` | `/api/members/search?q={query}` | Search members |
| `POST` | `/api/borrow-records/issue` | Issue a book to a member |
| `POST` | `/api/borrow-records/{id}/return` | Record book return |
| `GET` | `/api/members/{id}/borrow-history` | Member borrowing timeline |
| `GET` | `/api/borrow-records/issued` | Currently issued records |
| `GET` | `/api/borrow-records/overdue` | Overdue borrowing records |
| `GET` | `/api/dashboard/statistics` | Dashboard metrics |

To switch from Demo Mode to a live backend:
1. Open the **Settings Screen** in the app.
2. Toggle off **Demo Mode**.
3. Enter your Spring Boot Base URL (e.g., `http://10.0.2.2:8080/api` for emulator or `http://192.168.1.X:8080/api` for physical device).
4. Tap **Test API Connection**.
